 **Project Summary**
   This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze clinical data of heart disease patients and identify key survival trends across various age groups and conditions.
The dashboard provides a data-driven insight into how factors such as age, serum creatinine levels, ejection fraction, smoking, anaemia, high blood pressure, and diabetes affect patient survival.

**Key Insights**
Overall Survival Rate: 67.89%
Average Age of Survivors: 58.76 years
Total Survivors: 203
Total Deaths: 96
Highest survival seen in the 60–70 age group, with a survival rate over 75%
Lower survival rate observed in patients below 40 and those above 70

*Features of the Dashboard
Dynamic KPIs: Survival Rate, Avg Age, Total Survivals & Deaths
Dual-axis combo charts to show count vs. average serum creatinine & ejection fraction by age group
Gender-based filtering using custom buttons
Dumbbell and stacked area chart to show impact of clinical factors by age
Visually rich layout with custom icons and a medical theme

**Tools & Technologies**
--Power BI Desktop
DAX Measures for custom calculations (e.g., Survival Rate, Average Age)
Power Query for data transformation
Custom visual formatting & interactivity

**Dataset**
The dataset is a clinical heart failure record collection with fields like:
Age
DEATH_EVENT
Serum Creatinine
Ejection Fraction
Anaemia, Diabetes, High Blood Pressure
Smoking Status
.
Purpose
This dashboard helps medical professionals, researchers, and analysts understand which demographic and medical variables are most associated with survival — allowing better risk stratification and decision-making.
